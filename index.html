        <h1>My dog Iroko</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>Iroko is a mixed breed dog whom me and my sambo adopted from Spain in the 
            summer of 2020. He is a "pandemic dog", part of the pet adoption craze
            that shook the world when the Covid-19 pandemic began.
        </h2>

        <h2>
            Iroko is 2 years old. His favorite activities are eating, sleeping on 
            the couch, chewing sticks and playing with other neighborhood dogs. He has 
            many friends, but his best friend is Marcel, another rescue dog from
            Romania. What he absolutely hates is showering.
